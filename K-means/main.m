%% K-Means Clustering


%% ============= K-Means Clustering on Pixels ===============

fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n');

%  Loading an image of a bird
A = double(imread('bird_small.png'));

A = A / 255; % Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1

% Size of the image
img_size = size(A);

% Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
% Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
% This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);


K = 16; 
max_iters = 10;

% initializing centroids

randidx = randperm(size(X, 1));
% Take the first K examples as centroids
initial_centroids = X(randidx(1:K), :);

% Run K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters);

%% ================= Image Compression ======================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
%  compress an image. 

fprintf('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n');

% Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids);

% Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
% indices in idx. 

% We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
% (specified by it's index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids(idx,:);

% Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = reshape(X_recovered, img_size(1), img_size(2), 3);

% Display the original image 
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(A); 
title('Original');

% Display compressed image side by side
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imagesc(X_recovered)
title(sprintf('Compressed, with %d colors.', K));
