I implemented linear regression to predict prices of houses using two features size and number of bedrooms. Since these features are not comparable, they were normalized. The function for this can be found in 'featureNormalize'. This helps gradient descent converge faster. The file gradient descent contains code for computing the cost function as well as for performing gradient descent
